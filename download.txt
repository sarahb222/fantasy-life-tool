Go here to download the exe:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JCZjvQxnDFfOpWNzCRRQ8B9bY65y4lIV/view?usp=sharing

You also need the Images folder to be in the same folder as the ,exe, as well as the FLData.xlsx.

The program will make a FLActive.xlsx file as well. This is your save data.

If you want to restart, either delete or rename that file.
